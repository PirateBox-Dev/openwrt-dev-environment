# PirateBox OpenWRT Dev. Environment Scripts

This collection and documentation is for developing on scratch on PirateBox-OpenWRT packages, images and so on. All of those commands in the Makefile are customized or assume, that you don't rely on the current stable source.

## What this repository is:
It should help with the common task to be done on developing around. See Makefile for more comments.

## What this repository is __not__:
* NO newbie guide
* NO complete walk-through (yet)
* SHOULD NOT be used for only creating customized images, use [openwrt-image-build](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate) instead.

## Todo's
* Improve this README
* Add complete walk-through to set up the dev environment
* Improve comments in the Makefile
