--=== PirateBox OpenWRT Dev. Environment Scripts ===--

This collection and documentation is for developing on scratch on PirateBox-OpenWRT packages, images and so on. All of those commands in the Makefile are customized or assume, that you don't rely on the current stable source.

	The following things are not intended with that repository:

	- NO newbie guide
	- NO completly walk-through (yet)
	- SHOULD NOT used for only creating own customized images, use openwrt-image-build solo instead.


It should help with the common task to be done on developing around. See Makefile for more comments.

I'm going to improve the Makefile and the descriptions while daily work. Sorry, that is not self-explain style, as it should be. 

	regards Matthias
